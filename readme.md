1. Read a set of GIDAS files
2. Channel 'flow:total_mass'
3. Plot the given channel versus crank angle (each file in separate figure)
4. Create summary plot (average 'flow:total_mass' across all speed, for each single crank angle)
5. Create file containing the values shown in summary diagram

NOTES: - Values on diagram should be in grams - Try to make it possible for the user to define which channel to be ploted - Make it possible for the user to define where the results are stored and which speed cases have to be processed
